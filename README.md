# Week 6

TASK1 : Here we provide a starting point of the same simple harmonic oscillator code you worked on last time, where the Euler method is already implemented. Finish the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method and draw the results from Euler's method, RK2 method, and the analytical solution on the same plot. An example plot using dt = 0.01 seconds is attached.

TASK2 : Using dt = 0.01, measure the error in xpos at t=8.8s (where a vertical bar is provided) between the results from Euler's method and the analytical solution. Measure the error again using dt = 0.005. How does the two errors compare and why?

You may need to use the zoom tool (see red arrow in the same example figure). 
(If you don't see the zoom button, it means you haven't switched to the Automatic graphics backend we recommended in class. To do so, under Preferences > Ipython console > Graphics > Graphics backend, choose Automatic. Another screenshot is attached. Rerun the code and you should see figures appearing in pop up windows)

EXTRA CREDITS:
Worth 5 pts on top of the homework's 10 pts.
Similar problem with RK2. Using dt = 0.1, measure the error in xpos at t=8.8s  between the results from RK2 and the analytical solution. Measure the error again using dt = 0.005. How does the two errors compare and why?
