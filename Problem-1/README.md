# Week 6 Problem 1.

Here we provide a starting point of the same simple harmonic oscillator code you worked on last time, where the Euler method is already implemented. 

TASK 1 : a tentative choice of dt = 0.01 seconds is chosen here. Although it's not small enough to eliminate all visible errors, it's a good initial choice. If this dt were not given, how would you have come up with it by yourself? Provide a comment. Hint: what is the characteristic timescale of this problem? 

TASK 2 :  Using dt = 0.01, measure the error in xpos at t=8.8s (where a vertical bar is provided) between the results from Euler's method and the analytical solution. Measure the error again using dt = 0.005. How does the two errors compare and why?
