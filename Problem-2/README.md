# Week 6 Problem 2

Task 1: Without removing results from Euler's method, finish the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method and plot the results from Euler's method, RK2 method, and the analytical solution on the same plot. An example plot using dt = 0.01 seconds is attached.

You may need to use the zoom tool. See red arrow in the same example figure.

(If you don't see the zoom button, it means you haven't switched to the Automatic graphics backend we recommended in class. To do so, under Preferences > Ipython console > Graphics > Graphics backend, choose Automatic. Another screenshot is attached. Rerun the code and you should see figures appearing in pop up windows)


TASK2 : Similar with we we did in Problem 1, Using dt = 0.01, measure the error in xpos at t=8.8s  between the results from RK2 and the analytical solution. Measure the error again using dt = 0.005s. How do the two errors compare and why?
